    "Humanity often uses the arts and story telling to reflect on important issues to society and answer question about who we are and where the future will take us. The concept or artificial intelligence has greatly captured human interest over the last century. Many stories explore how to determine if a machine is intelligent, and whether to extend rights of beings with Artificial Intelligence.\n",

    "We want to look at the use of AI in Books and Movies and TV Shows.   Pick a movie / Book / Game that illustrates some type of AI Character.  You can pick anything but some examples are:  (Ex Machina, Data (Star Trek TNG), IRobot, A.I., 2001: A Space Oddessy, 9, WALL-E, Interstellar, etc )\n",

    "A group go to the space A group of astronauts travels through a wormhole to find a new planet for humans to live on. The main character, Cooper, goes on the mission with scientist Amelia Brand and two AI robots, TARS and CASE.\n",
    "\n",
    "TARS is a tall, rectangular robot made of metal panels that move and spin in creative ways. It doesn’t look human, but it can talk, make jokes, and think on its own. TARS was built by NASA to help with space missions and protect the crew.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose and Relationships\n",
    "TARS’s main purpose is to help the astronauts complete their mission safely. It can control the ship, make quick calculations, and even sacrifice itself to save the humans. The astronauts start off unsure about trusting it, but over time, TARS proves it’s dependable and loyal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crew treats TARS like a teammate, not just a machine. It understands humor, honesty, and even friendship. This shows how AI can form strong relationships with humans when built with empathy and care.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does TARS Think It’s Intelligent?\n",
    "TARS doesn’t say directly that it’s intelligent, but it clearly acts like it is. It understands emotions, makes choices, and speaks naturally. The humans see it as intelligent too—they talk to it like a person and rely on its judgment. Even though TARS doesn’t “feel” emotions the same way humans do, it understands them well enough to show kindness and humor.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Testing and the Turing Test\n",
    "The Turing Test, created by scientist Alan Turing, checks if a machine can “think.” If a human talks to a machine and can’t tell it’s a machine, the AI passes the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Interstellar, TARS would likely pass the Turing Test. Its voice, humor, and problem-solving skills make it seem human-like. If someone talked to TARS without seeing it, they might think they were talking to a person. However, TARS still follows its programming and doesn’t truly feel emotions, so the Turing Test might not show its full intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weak AI or Strong AI\n",
    "TARS is an example of strong AI. Weak AI can only do one task, like a calculator or search engine, but strong AI can think and make decisions. TARS shows strong AI because it reasons, adapts, and understands human behavior. It doesn’t just follow orders—it acts creatively and makes moral choices."
